# meanReversion_lemon.markets

The files above are all you need to run a mean reversion python script in the cloud. Simply download/clone the repo and fiddle around with it yourself.
To host in the cloud, I recommend heroku, as you can simply connect a GitHub repo and everythink should work seamlessly.
