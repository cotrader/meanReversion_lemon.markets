# meanReversion_lemon.markets

The files above are all you need to run a mean reversion python script in the cloud. Simply download/clone the repo and fiddle around with it yourself.
To host in the cloud, I recommend heroku, as you can simply connect a GitHub repo and everythink should work seamlessly. [Here](https://dev.to/towernter/hosting-a-python-script-on-heroku-using-github-khj) you can find a great tutorial on how to connect your python script to heroku.
